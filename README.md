# Word Frequency Analyzer

## Description

This project analyzes the frequency of words in a given paragraph and displays the top three most frequently occurring words.

## How it Works

1. **Paragraph:** The input paragraph is provided in the `paragraph` variable.
2. **Preprocessing:** The paragraph is converted to lowercase, and punctuation marks are removed using regular expressions.
3. **Word Counting:** A JavaScript object (`counter`) is used to count the occurrences of each word.
4. **Sorting:** The word count results are converted into an array (`arr`) and sorted in descending order based on word frequency.
5. **Display:** The top three words along with their counts are displayed in an HTML element with the id `app`.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or copy the HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. View the top three most frequently occurring words in the provided paragraph.

## Customization

- Feel free to modify the `paragraph` variable with your own text for analysis.
- Adjust the CSS styles in the `<style>` section to customize the appearance of the result.

## Requirements

- A web browser that supports JavaScript.

## Example

```javascript
var paragraph = `...`;  // Input your paragraph here
// ... (rest of the code)
```
